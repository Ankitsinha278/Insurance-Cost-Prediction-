# 🏥 Insurance Cost Prediction

This project analyzes a medical insurance dataset to identify key factors influencing insurance charges. Using Python and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and visualization to derive insights helpful for predicting insurance costs.

## 🔍 Objective

To explore how various features like age, BMI, smoking status, and number of children impact the insurance premium. The goal is to extract actionable insights and prepare the dataset for further modeling and cost prediction.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas.
- Checked for missing/null values and cleaned the data.
- Analyzed feature distributions and relationships using visual tools:
  - **Count plots** for categorical variables like smoking and region.
  - **Scatter plots** to see the relationship between age, BMI, and charges.
  - **Pair plots** to understand the combined interaction between multiple variables.
- Highlighted the strong influence of smoking and BMI on insurance charges.

## 🧼 Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Verified data types and handled inconsistencies.
- Encoded categorical variables if needed (for modeling).
- Identified and removed outliers where necessary.

## 📈 Key Insights

- Smokers pay significantly higher insurance charges than non-smokers.
- Charges increase with age and BMI.
- Number of children has a slight influence but is less significant than other factors.


## 🔮 Future Work

- Build predictive models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluate model accuracy using metrics like MAE, MSE, R²
- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit for a web-based interface

## 📌 Dataset

The dataset used is a publicly available insurance dataset with features such as:
- Age
- Sex
- BMI
- Number of children
- Smoking status
- Region
- Charges (target variable)
